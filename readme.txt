Create a true Supermarket shopping experience. Sort and show products on Shop page by category - auto show On Sale or Featured first, Endless Scroll.
  
== Description ==

Walk into any shop, Supermarket or Department store and what do you see - products organized and grouped in aisle and areas. 'Walk' into any WooCommerce store page and what does your customer / client see - an almost entirely random display of products sorted mostly by date of publishing.  That has always seemed crazy to us. What shop owner would just keep stacking new stock at the front of all the other stock in their shop in any order. None is the answer! So why is that exactly what all of our virtual WooCommerce stores do?

We decided to build a plugin that would fix that. With WooCommerce Product Sort and Display installed you can:

* Sort products to show by category on shop page.
* Sort category order by drag and drop.
* Set the number of products to show per category with link to view all.
* Set to auto show all current 'On Sale' products first in each category.
* Set to auto show all 'featured' products in each category.
* Intelligent Navigation shows customers the total number of products in the category they are viewing with a link to view all.
* Endless Scroll feature (option) for seamless customer scrolling through the entire shop page makes for quick and very easy shop browsing.  

= Why we built this Plugin =

Product positioning in a physical retail store is science. It is no different in an online store - positioning products for when visitors 'step' into your online store is a crucial sales tool. We have always felt the Store page and Product Category pages product display is woefully random. The default WooCommerce Product sort gives little or no real control on positioning products. We have completely changed that with this plugin by allowing you to sort and position products by category on the shop page (on all pages on the Pro version).

= Shop Page Display Features =

* Show products by Category group.
* Use WooCommerce Product Categories to sort display order by drag and drop.
* Set the number of products to show per category.
* Set which products show first from the category - On Sale, Featured of the default latest. 
* Set how many category group of products show before pagination or endless scroll loads.
* Activate Endless scroll feature for your shop page.
* Select Auto Endless Scroll or Scroll on Click.

= 2 Brand New Product Sort Features =

* Auto show any 'On Sale' products first in the Category View on shop page.
* Auto show any 'featured' products first in the category view.

* WYSIWYG separator style editor.
* Set padding in px above and below the separator.  

= Lite Version Support =

As a Lite Version user please post all support requests to the plugins WordPress Support forum. We do not watch that forum and posting there you will be relying on another user for support not an a3rev team member. Pro Version Licence holders have 'write' access to the a3rev support forum and Lifetime priority support, not from support staff but from the developers.

= Priority Support =

Please note that we do not provide support for our Lite Version plugins. Hundreds of thousands of plugin downloads has proven that vast majority of the support requests we get have nothing to do with our plugins but are related to bugs in the users theme or other plugins they have installed. We give priority support to those users who purchase a Pro Version license. In this plugins case, we offer a single payment, Lifetime License fee which includes access to and full support from the a3rev developers on the plugins support forum.

* English (default) - always included.
*.po file (wc_psad.po) in languages folder for translations.
* If you do a translation for your site please send it to us for inclusion in the plugin language folder. We'll acknowledge your work here. [Go here](http://a3rev.com/contact-us-page/) to send your translation files to us.
