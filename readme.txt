Create a true Supermarket shopping experience. Sort and show products on Shop page by category - auto show On Sale or Featured first, Endless Scroll.
  
== Description ==

Walk into any shop, Supermarket or Department store and what do you see - products organized and grouped in aisle and areas. 'Walk' into any WooCommerce store page and what does your customer / client see - an almost entirely random display of products sorted mostly by date of publishing.  

That has always seemed crazy to us. What shop owner would just keep stacking new stock at the front of all the other stock in their shop in any order. None is the answer! So why is that exactly what all of our virtual WooCommerce stores do?

We decided to build a plugin that would fix that. With WooCommerce Product Sort and Display installed you can:

* Sort products to show by category on shop page.
* Sort category order on shop page by drag and drop.
* Set the number of products to show per category on the shop page with link to view all.
* If Parent Category has no products attached to it - will show products from the Parents Child Categories.
* Set to auto show all current 'On Sale' products first in each category on the shop page.
* Set to auto show all 'featured' products in each category on the shop page.
* Intelligent Navigation shows customers the total number of products in the category they are viewing with a link to view all.
* Endless Scroll feature (option) for seamless customer scrolling through the entire shop page makes for quick and very easy shop browsing.
