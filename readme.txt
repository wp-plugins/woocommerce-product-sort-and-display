Create a true Supermarket shopping experience. Sort and show products on Shop page by category - auto show On Sale or Featured first, Endless Scroll.
  
== Description ==

Walk into any shop, Supermarket or Department store and what do you see - products organized and grouped in aisle and areas. 'Walk' into any WooCommerce store page and what does your customer / client see - an almost entirely random display of products sorted mostly by date of publishing.  That has always seemed crazy to us. What shop owner would just keep stacking new stock at the front of all the other stock in their shop in any order. None is the answer! So why is that exactly what all of our virtual WooCommerce stores do?

We decided to build a plugin that would fix that. With WooCommerce Product Sort and Display installed you can:

* Sort products to show by category on shop page.
* Sort category order by drag and drop.
* Set the number of products to show per category with link to view all.
* Set to auto show all current 'On Sale' products first in each category.
* Set to auto show all 'featured' products in each category.
* Intelligent Navigation shows customers the total number of products in the category they are viewing with a link to view all.
* Endless Scroll feature (option) for seamless customer scrolling through the entire shop page makes for quick and very easy shop browsing.  

= Why we built this Plugin =

Product positioning in a physical retail store is science. It is no different in an online store - positioning products for when visitors 'step' into your online store is a crucial sales tool. We have always felt the Store page and Product Category pages product display is woefully random. The default WooCommerce Product sort gives little or no real control on positioning products. We have completely changed that with this plugin by allowing you to sort and position products by category on the shop page (on all pages on the Pro version).

= Shop Page Display Features =

* Show products by Category group.
* Use WooCommerce Product Categories to sort display order by drag and drop.
* Set the number of products to show per category.
* Set which products show first from the category - On Sale, Featured of the default latest. 
* Set how many category group of products show before pagination or endless scroll loads.
* Activate Endless scroll feature for your shop page.
* Select Auto Endless Scroll or Scroll on Click.

= 2 Brand New Product Sort Features =

* Auto show any 'On Sale' products first in the Category View on shop page.
* Auto show any 'featured' products first in the category view.

= Intelligent Browsing =

* Show the current number of products being viewed and total products in Category.
* 'No more product to view' message when all products are showing.

= Endless Scroll Features =

* Enable/Disable Endless Scroll on Shop Page
* Set number of Product category groups to show per endless scroll.
* Options of auto scroll or scroll on click.

= Product Category Group Visual Separator =

* Enable/Disable a visual separator between each Product Category group of products.
* WYSIWYG separator style editor.
* Set padding in px above and below the separator.  

= Mobile Responsive App style admin interface =

Like WordPress we believe that a3rev plugin users should be able to configure and tweak our plugins settings while on the go, right from their mobile or tablet. This plugins features an app style admin interface with Switches and a smart interface that hides associated settings when a feature is not turned ON.

* 100% compatible with WordPress v3.8.0 admin interface.
* Backward compatibility to WordPress v3.5.0
* App style admin interface.
* Admin app interface is fully mobile and tablet responsive.

= Lite & Pro Version Admin Interface =

All a3rev Lite Version plugins have exactly the same admin interface as the Pro Version. Pro Version features and settings are easy to spot on the admin dashboard and on Product Category edit pages as they are inside of a Yellow border. The Pro Version settings are all active on the admin panels so they can be used to get a great idea of how they work and what is available BUT the settings do not save when changes are saved and hence are not applied to the front end. Upgrading to the Pro version activates all the Pro version Features and Settings and removes the Yellow side bar and borders.

= Lite Version Support =

As a Lite Version user please post all support requests to the plugins WordPress Support forum. We do not watch that forum and posting there you will be relying on another user for support, not an a3rev team member. Upgrading to a Pro Version License gives 'write' access to the a3rev support forum and hence Lifetime priority support as part of the License.

= Pro Version Upgrade =

This plugin has a Pro Version upgrade that add more functionality to this Free version. You will see all of the available upgrade features on the plugins admin panel, in the Yellow sidebar. Those Pro features include

= Product Category Display Features =
Upgrading to the Pro Version gives you all of the features that you get on the Shop page with the Lite Version applied to Product Categories, Subcategories and Product tag pages - plus more:

* Show Sub Categories with products on Parent Category page.
* Set the number of products to show from Parent Cat with Endless Scroll - view more products.
* Set the number of products to show per sub category, globally (applies to all) or on an individual sub category basis.
* Set which products show first from sub category - On Sale, Featured of the default latest. Set globally and on individual sub cats.
* Set how many sub category groups of products show before pagination or endless scroll loads.
* Activate Endless scroll feature for your product category pages.
* Select Auto Endless Scroll or Scroll on Click.
* Full Scroll on click feature custom style (button or linked text) and position settings.

= More Shop Page Display features =

* Set number of products to display in Categories on a category by category basis (over rides the global setting).
* Filter the products to show for each category independent of the Global settings on a category by category basis.
* WYSIWYG Scroll on click feature custom style (button or linked text) and position settings.

* Show count is auto updated on each endless scroll event when view products in the parent category.
* No more product to view message when all products are showing.

= Priority Support =

Please note that we do not provide support for our Lite Version plugins. Hundreds of thousands of plugin downloads has proven that vast majority of the support requests we get have nothing to do with our plugins but are related to bugs in the users theme or other plugins they have installed. We give priority support to those users who purchase a Pro Version license. In this plugins case, we offer a single payment, Lifetime License fee which includes access to and full support from the a3rev developers on the plugins support forum.

= Localization =

* English (default) - always included.
*.po file (wc_psad.po) in languages folder for translations.
* If you do a translation for your site please send it to us for inclusion in the plugin language folder. We'll acknowledge your work here. [Go here](http://a3rev.com/contact-us-page/) to send your translation files to us.
